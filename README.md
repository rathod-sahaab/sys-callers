# sys-callers

Want to learn _linux programming_? me too! 

This project implements many standard tools like:
- [x] ls (sysls)
- [ ] curl
- [ ] cp

etc.

Every project is an independent one residing in this monorepo. 
We use C++17 for easing trivial tasks like output formating,
argument parsing etc. so that we can focus more on our main
objectives _i.e._ **syscalls**.

Projects follow [rathod-sahaab/cpp-conan-template](https://github.com/rathod-sahaab/cpp-conan-template).
